# Universal Bullet Ricochet

**Description:**
Enhance your Garry's Mod experience with the Universal Bullet Ricochet addon! This script adds realistic bullet ricochets to all your weapons, making gunfights more dynamic and exciting.

**Features:**
- **Realistic Ricochets:** Bullets can bounce off sharp surfaces like metal and tile, adding an unpredictable element to your firefights.
